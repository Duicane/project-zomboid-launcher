Project Zomboid - Launcher for Linux and OSX
=============================================

Project Zomboid is an awesome indie Zombie survival game. The atmosphere is great, the environment as well. The
romero-like zombies are well made. The only issue is that the distributed files only work for Windows.

With the little adaptation that I did here, it works also great on OSX and Linux :

* Download or clone this project
* Run ProjectZomboid.sh (or ProjectZomboid.command on OSX)
* On first run, it will download ProjectZomboid and a library
  automatically
* Profit !

The game requires a login credential that you can buy at

Known issues
------------

* Issue: The game screen flickers on the login screen
* Solution: Just login
