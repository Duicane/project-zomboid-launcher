Project Zomboid - Launcher for Linux and OSX
=============================================

Project Zomboid is an awesome indie Zombie survival game. The atmosphere is great, the environment as well. The
romero-like zombies are well made. Only problem; it only works on Windows.

With the little adaptation that I did here, it works also great on OSX and Linux !
