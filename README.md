Project Zomboid - Launcher for Linux and OSX
=============================================

Project Zomboid is an awesome indie Zombie survival game. The atmosphere is great, the environment as well. The
romero-like zombies are well made. Only problem; it only works on Windows.

With the little adaptation that I did here, it works also great on OSX and Linux !

Get the game
------------

* [Buy Project Zomboid](http://projectzomboid.com/blog/index.php/buy-our-games/) to get a login
* [Download the launcher](https://github.com/zimbatm/project-zomboid-posix-launcher/zipball/master)
* Unpack
* Run `ProjectZomboid.sh` on Linux and `ProjectZomboid.command` on OSX
* The first time, it will take a while to get the game automatically
* Play !

Problem ?
---------

* Issue: The game screen flickers on the login screen
* Solution: Just login

Have another problem ? [Create a ticket](https://github.com/zimbatm/project-zomboid-posix-launcher/issues/new) with as much details as possible. Or send me an email at jonas@pfenniger.name
